# Apr 1 - Apr 8 Progress

## Doing

## Done

* **DODGE:** 
    * discussed code with Sherry to figure out what goes where
    * went through DODGE code, figured out potential optimizations
        * From paper, DODGE is stable across epsilon values. Experimentally, 0.2 works best. Therefore, we chose 0.2.
        * Need not seed with random algorithms; instead, seed with intuitive guesses.
* **Baseline results:**
    * Text mining:
        * pitsA (4 classes): 64.38%
        * pitsC (6 classes): 88%
        * pitsD (5 classes): 85.71% 

## Todo

* Find d2h, popt, and popt20 metrics for text mining.
