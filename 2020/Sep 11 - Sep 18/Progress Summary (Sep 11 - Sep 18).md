## Issue close time

| Result                                            | Elaboration                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GHOST non-DL < DODGE < GHOST-DL                   | GHOST on non-DL learners performs *worse* than regular DODGE in some cases; at best, it ties with GHOST, but never wins. Therefore, weighted losses help, but only DL can do well with WFO. |
| Literature review                                 | [See spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1glzYqv0AWTC7H3Vcpo2EWVtNg5AHd66PfgRu7K1kW4E/edit?usp=sharing) |
| Results on Firefox, Eclipse, and Chromium data    | [See spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/139WPGqDAUjcLVaL0TGGaNFqIi5jrw2ThbvZslQBBDz4/edit?usp=sharing) \| our approach is fast (3.5 minutes), and uses less data (throws away unnecessary stuff). |
| GHOST with round robin on issue close time is bad | It has worse performance, and also runs significantly slower. |
